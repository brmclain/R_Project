Data Science and Statistical Learning

School group project using Rstudio. 

Use chosen dataset to create and try to answer hypothesis. Use two different models to compare 
  performance and make a report on the findings.

My main responsibility was creating the the kNN model and working with the member in charge of
  writing the report to incorporating it.
